# Peer2Pressure

Peer2Pressure is a Social Distribution Network project for CMPUT404. More details are shown in the link below:

## Frontend 

The team has decided to use React to develop the user interfaces. Before creating pages and components in React, the team first went through the design process to kickstart a potential prototype the team will follow in creating these user interfaces.

More information about how to start the React app can be found further down below or through this [link](# Getting Started with Create React App)

### Design

The team decided to use Figma to draft our prototypes, including the moodboard and the style tile. Further details about the design can be see in the link below:

#### Moodboard

The team needed inspiration on how the user interface would look like. We have found this inspiration from behance and we included snippets of its creative outlook towards our moodboard shown below:

![moodboard]("insert link")

#### Styletile

Fortunately, the inspiration source also included color scheme for their mockups. Shown in the style below are the hex codes for the color scheme in the user interface, typography of various headings, screen used for prototypes, as well as icons that were used. 

![styletile]("insert link")


#### Prototype 

On to the main part, the image shown below is the partial interaction of various pages and components. Note that these prototypes are not final and may not accurately depict what the final iteration will be. As the proper procedure of iterative design process, these prototypes will be improved on overtime to accommodate to the various user stories that will be implemented over the course.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
